## Compilation Instructions
A makefile has been made to allow for easier compilation. Navigate to the /src subdirectory for the following commands to be valid: \
	&ensp; &ensp;To compile all .java files run 'make.' \
	&ensp; &ensp;'Make run' compiles all .java files and runs main from Deadwood.java. \
	&ensp; &ensp;'make clean' removes all .class files.
